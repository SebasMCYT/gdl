## Credits
### Song & Github credits
Each song has its respective credits in its file and in-game. The files are inside [the songs folder.](https://github.com/SebasMCYT/gdl/tree/main/songs)

Icons used in this README were taken from the [original game.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash)
  
### Game credits
Developed by [supersonicoGames](https://github.com/SebasMCYT)

Original game made by [RobTop Games](https://robtopgames.com)
  
Most of the textures and sounds were taken from the [original game.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash)

Songs used in the base game were made by [Waterflame](https://www.youtube.com/@WaterflameMusic) and [Dunderpatrullen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52orkO0DOHDVo_jT2o3EAg).

This game does not try to plagiarize Geometry Dash, but to be a recreation of the base game made in Scratch. This game does not contain the levels of the original game, but new ones; If you want to play the original levels, buy the original game instead of playing this.
  
This game was made on [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org) (a Scratch mod) and published on the Game Jolt website.
  
I DO NOT earn money with this project.
